# AutoArmor+
AutoArmor+ is a plugin mainly designed for reducing the time needed to equip armor. Right clicking a piece of armor will automatically equip it if it is better than the current armor piece.

**A few notes:**

 - The code is a little messy, it was a quick project I made for fun.
 - You can ask for updates and support on the TeamMT Discord server, link [here](https://discord.gg/CUdgVvVSsa).
 - Rating the plugin is always allowed, check it out on Spigot.
